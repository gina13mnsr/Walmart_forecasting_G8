# Walmart_forecasting_G8
 In this sales forecasting project, we will use the historical sales data of 45 Walmart stores based on store location, department, and week to Predict the sales for each department.
 Every Departmental store chain like Walmart wants to predict the store sales in the future so that inventory planning can be done. Along with that, sales prediction helps to increase/decrease store staff based on the rush (More sales can mean more customers are coming to the stores). Also, it is always a good idea to do sales and revenue forecasting to better understand the company's cash-flows and overall growth.
